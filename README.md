**Tic Tac Toe Game**             
A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players X and O take turns to mark squares in a 3x3 grid. The game detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw, and it allows players to reset and play again.

- Player turn display          
- Win, loss, and draw detection      
- Reset button to start a new game

- CSS: Styling for game layout and responsive design

**How to Play**         
- Open the game in a web browser.          
- Player X always goes first. Click on any tile in the grid to place your mark.          
- Players alternate turns by clicking empty tiles, with Player O following Player X.        
- The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins!      
- If all tiles are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.        
- Click "Play Again" to reset the game.
